No, you don't need to update your `.zshrc` file directly - that's one of the main benefits of this dotfiles organization approach!

Here's how it works behind the scenes:

## The Symlink System

1. Your actual `.zshrc` file in your home directory (~/.zshrc) is a **symlink** that points to `~/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc`.

2. When you ran the install script, it created this symlink:
   ```bash
   ln -sf $HOME/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc $HOME/.zshrc
   ```

3. This means when your shell loads `.zshrc`, it's actually loading the file from your dotfiles repository.

## The Modular Loading System

Inside your main `~/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc` file, there's code that automatically loads all the component files:

```bash
# Load all alias files
for alias_file in ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/dotfiles/zsh/aliases/*.zsh; do
  source $alias_file
done

# Load all function files 
for function_file in ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/dotfiles/zsh/functions/*.zsh; do
  source $function_file
done

# Other similar loading blocks for configs, etc.
```

This means:

1. When you add or modify an alias in `~/dotfiles/zsh/aliases/navigation.zsh`
2. And then run `source ~/.zshrc`
3. Your main zshrc file automatically loads all .zsh files in the aliases directory
4. Your new/modified alias becomes available immediately

This modular approach gives you these benefits:
- Keep related configurations together (all git aliases in one file)
- Make changes without editing a massive monolithic .zshrc file
- Easily disable specific components by renaming files (e.g., `git.zsh` to `git.zsh.disabled`)
- Maintain organization as your configuration grows

Does that help clarify how the system works? The beauty is that you never need to directly edit the `~/.zshrc` file in your home directory - everything is managed through your organized dotfiles repository.
