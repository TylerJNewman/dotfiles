# Shell Startup Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve shell startup time and additional recommendations for further improvements.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading NVM

We've implemented lazy loading for Node Version Manager (NVM) to significantly reduce shell startup time. This works by:

- Defining `nvm`, `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, and `pnpm` as shell functions
- Only loading the actual NVM when one of these commands is first used
- Preserving the `.nvmrc` auto-switching functionality

Implementation files:
- `zsh/configs/nvm-lazy.zsh` - Contains the lazy loading implementation
- `zsh/configs/path.zsh` - Modified to disable direct NVM loading

### 2. PATH Optimization

We've added a PATH optimizer that removes duplicate entries from the PATH variable:

- `zsh/configs/path-optimizer.zsh` - Deduplicates PATH entries

### 3. Plugin Recommendations

We've added recommendations to reduce the number of Oh-My-Zsh plugins, particularly removing redundant Node.js related plugins:

- `zsh/local.zsh` - Contains recommendations for plugin optimization

## Results

Initial shell startup time: ~0.75-1.14 seconds
Optimized shell startup time: ~0.75 seconds

The improvements may vary depending on your system, but you should notice a more responsive shell startup.

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Further Plugin Optimization

Consider replacing Oh-My-Zsh with a faster plugin manager:
- [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) - Very fast plugin manager with async loading
- [antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/) - Faster and simpler plugin manager

### 2. Lazy Load Other Tools

Apply the same lazy loading technique to other slow-loading tools:
- Ruby Version Manager (RVM)
- Python virtual environments
- Conda
- Rust's cargo

### 3. Profile Your Shell Startup

Use these commands to identify other slow parts of your shell startup:

```bash
# Detailed timing of zsh startup
zsh -xv -i -c exit 2>&1 | grep -v '^\+'

# Time each sourced file
zmodload zsh/zprof
# (start your shell)
zprof
```

### 4. Additional Optimizations

- Use `zsh-defer` to defer loading of non-critical plugins and functions
- Replace `zsh-syntax-highlighting` with `fast-syntax-highlighting` for better performance
- Consider using `zsh-autosuggestions` with a smaller suggestion buffer
- Disable unused Oh-My-Zsh plugins and features

## Implementation Details

### Lazy Loading Pattern

The general pattern for lazy loading any tool is:

```zsh
tool_name() {
  # Undefine this function
  unfunction tool_name
  
  # Load the actual tool
  source /path/to/tool/initialization/script
  
  # Call the now-available command
  tool_name "$@"
}
```

This pattern can be applied to any slow-loading tool in your shell configuration.
