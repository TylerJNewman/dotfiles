# My Dotfiles

A thoughtfully organized collection of my development environment configuration files.

## Quick Start Guide

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

# Run the installation script
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh

# Restart your terminal or source your zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

> **Note**: This setup requires a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for proper symbol display in the terminal. The installation script will install Hack Nerd Font, but you'll need to configure your terminal to use it.

$character"""
```

> **Note**: This configuration requires a Nerd Font to display special symbols correctly. The installation script installs Hack Nerd Font, but you'll need to configure your terminal to use it.

> **Detailed Documentation**: For a comprehensive guide on using and customizing Starship, see [docs/starship-guide.md](docs/starship-guide.md)

##### Understanding Your Prompt

Here's how to interpret the different elements in your Starship prompt:

###### Directory Display
```
~/projects/my-repo
```
- Shows your current directory path
- Truncated to 5 levels deep (configurable)
- Home directory is shown as `~`
- Read-only directories are marked with a lock symbol: ` Û∞åæ`

###### Git Branch
```
 Û∞ò¨ main
```
- The ` Û∞ò¨ ` symbol indicates you're in a git repository
- Followed by the current branch name (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/new-feature`)

###### Git Status Symbols
```
[+!‚á°‚úò]
```

These symbols show the state of your git repository:

| Symbol | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `+` | Staged changes | You have changes staged for commit |
| `!` | Modified files | You have unstaged modified files |
| `?` | Untracked files | You have new files not yet tracked by git |
| `‚úò` | Deleted files | You have deleted files in your working directory |
| `‚á°` | Ahead of remote | Your local branch is ahead of the remote (needs push) |
| `‚á£` | Behind remote | Your local branch is behind the remote (needs pull) |
| `‚áï` | Diverged | Your branch has diverged from the remote (needs merge/rebase) |
| `¬ª` | Renamed files | You have renamed files in your working directory |
| `=` | Conflicted files | You have merge conflicts that need resolution |
| `S` | Stashed changes | You have changes saved in git stash |

###### Command Duration
```
took 5s
```
- Shows the execution time for commands that take longer than 2 seconds
- Helps identify slow commands in your workflow

###### Shell Indicator
```
zsh
```
- Displays which shell you're currently using
- Useful when switching between different shells

###### Prompt Character
```
‚ùØ
```
- Green when the previous command succeeded
- Red when the previous command failed
- Provides immediate visual feedback on command success/failure

##### Examples of Common Git States

1. **Clean Repository**
   ```
   ~/projects/my-repo Û∞ò¨ main
   zsh ‚ùØ
   ```

2. **Uncommitted Changes**
   ```
   ~/projects/my-repo Û∞ò¨ main [!]
   zsh ‚ùØ
   ```

3. **Staged Changes Ready to Commit**
   ```
   ~/projects/my-repo Û∞ò¨ main [+]
   zsh ‚ùØ
   ```

4. **Need to Push Commits**
   ```
   ~/projects/my-repo Û∞ò¨ main [‚á°]
   zsh ‚ùØ
   ```

5. **Need to Pull Changes**
   ```
   ~/projects/my-repo Û∞ò¨ main [‚á£]
   zsh ‚ùØ
   ```

6. **Complex State (Multiple Indicators)**
   ```
   ~/projects/my-repo Û∞ò¨ feature/new-feature [+!‚á°?]
   zsh ‚ùØ
   ```
   This indicates:
   - You're on the `feature/new-feature` branch
   - You have staged changes (`+`)
   - You have unstaged modifications (`!`)
   - You have commits that need to be pushed (`‚á°`)
   - You have untracked files (`?`)

##### Customizing Your Prompt

To modify your Starship prompt, edit `~/.config/starship.toml`. Some common customizations:

```toml
# Change directory display
[directory]
truncation_length = 3  # Show fewer directory levels
style = "cyan bold"    # Change directory color

# Change git branch display
[git_branch]
symbol = "üåø "         # Use a different branch symbol
style = "green bold"   # Change branch color

# Change character prompt
[character]
success_symbol = "[‚ûú](bold green)"  # Different success symbol
error_symbol = "[‚úó](bold red)"      # Different error symbol
```

For more customization options, see the [Starship documentation](https://starship.rs/config/).

### Package Manager Aliases

The configuration includes consistent aliases across different JavaScript package managers:

| NPM | Yarn | PNPM | Bun | Description |
|-----|------|------|-----|-------------|
| `ni` | - | `pi` | `bi` | Install dependencies |
| - | `ya` | `pa` | `ba` | Add a package |

## Best Practices for Maintaining This Repository

### For Contributors (Including LLMs)

1. **File Organization**:
   - Place new aliases in the appropriate category file in `zsh/aliases/`
   - Create new category files when needed (5+ related aliases)
   - Keep functions in `zsh/functions/` with descriptive names

2. **Documentation**:
   - Comment complex functions with usage examples
   - Maintain a consistent comment style (# for comments, ## for section headers)
   - Update this README when adding major features

3. **Security**:
   - Never commit API keys, tokens, or passwords
   - Use environment variables sourced from `zsh/secrets/env.zsh` (git-ignored)
   - Provide example configuration files with placeholder values

4. **Performance**:
   - Check shell startup time before/after changes: `time zsh -i -c exit`
   - Lazy-load heavy or infrequently used functions
   - Profile for bottlenecks: `zmodload zsh/zprof` at top, `zprof` at bottom

5. **Testing**:
   - Test changes in a clean environment when possible
   - Check compatibility across different systems (macOS/Linux)
   - Validate with `shellcheck` for bash/sh scripts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Nerd Font Symbols

If you see boxes, question marks, or missing symbols in your prompt:

1. Verify a Nerd Font is installed:
   ```bash
   ls ~/Library/Fonts/*Nerd* || ls /Library/Fonts/*Nerd*
   ```

2. Configure your terminal to use the Nerd Font:
   - **iTerm2**: Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Font ‚Üí Change Font
   - **VS Code**: Settings ‚Üí Terminal ‚Ä∫ Integrated: Font Family ‚Üí Add a Nerd Font (e.g., "Hack Nerd Font")

#### Slow Shell Startup

If your shell is starting slowly:

1. Profile your startup time:
   ```bash
   time zsh -i -c exit
   ```

2. Identify slow plugins or configurations:
   ```bash
   # Add to top of .zshrc
   zmodload zsh/zprof
   
   # Add to bottom of .zshrc
   zprof
   ```

3. Consider lazy-loading rarely used tools or disabling unused plugins

#### Tool Version Mismatches

If you see version warnings during installation:

1. Update the specific tool:
   ```bash
   # For Homebrew packages
   brew upgrade [package-name]
   
   # For Starship
   curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
   ```

##### Customizing Your Prompt

To modify your Starship prompt, edit `~/.config/starship.toml`. Some common customizations:

```toml
# Change directory display
[directory]
truncation_length = 3  # Show fewer directory levels
style = "cyan bold"    # Change directory color

# Change git branch display
[git_branch]
symbol = "üåø "         # Use a different branch symbol
style = "green bold"   # Change branch color

# Change character prompt
[character]
success_symbol = "[‚ûú](bold green)"  # Different success symbol
error_symbol = "[‚úó](bold red)"      # Different error symbol
```

For more customization options, see the [Starship documentation](https://starship.rs/config/).

## Best Practices for Maintaining This Repository

### For Contributors (Including LLMs)

1. **File Organization**:
   - Place new aliases in the appropriate category file in `zsh/aliases/`
   - Create new category files when needed (5+ related aliases)
   - Keep functions in `zsh/functions/` with descriptive names

2. **Documentation**:
   - Comment complex functions with usage examples
   - Maintain a consistent comment style (# for comments, ## for section headers)
   - Update this README when adding major features

3. **Security**:
   - Never commit API keys, tokens, or passwords
   - Use environment variables sourced from `zsh/secrets/env.zsh` (git-ignored)
   - Provide example configuration files with placeholder values

4. **Performance**:
   - Check shell startup time before/after changes: `time zsh -i -c exit`
   - Lazy-load heavy or infrequently used functions
   - Profile for bottlenecks: `zmodload zsh/zprof` at top, `zprof` at bottom

5. **Testing**:
   - Test changes in a clean environment when possible
   - Check compatibility across different systems (macOS/Linux)
   - Validate with `shellcheck` for bash/sh scripts

6. **Version Control**:
   - Use meaningful commit messages with the format: `[component] Brief description`
   - Group related changes in a single commit
   - Update version history in this README for significant changes

7. **Machine-specific Customization**:
   - Use `zsh/local.zsh` (git-ignored) for machine-specific settings
   - Detect OS and adapt configurations when necessary

8. **Dependencies**:
   - Document all external dependencies in this README
   - Consider providing installation instructions or fallbacks

9. **Cleanup**:
   - Regularly review for obsolete configurations
   - Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed
   - Consolidate similar functions and aliases

### Automating Maintenance

Consider these automation opportunities:
- Periodic linting with shellcheck in CI
- Automated backup of dotfiles to private storage
- Scheduled review reminders to clean up unused aliases/functions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Nerd Font Symbols

If you see boxes, question marks, or missing symbols in your prompt:

1. Verify a Nerd Font is installed:
   ```bash
   ls ~/Library/Fonts/*Nerd* || ls /Library/Fonts/*Nerd*
   ```

2. Configure your terminal to use the Nerd Font:
   - **iTerm2**: Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Font ‚Üí Change Font
   - **VS Code**: Settings ‚Üí Terminal ‚Ä∫ Integrated: Font Family ‚Üí Add a Nerd Font (e.g., "Hack Nerd Font")

#### Slow Shell Startup

If your shell is starting slowly:

1. Profile your startup time:
   ```bash
   time zsh -i -c exit
   ```

2. Identify slow plugins or configurations:
   ```bash
   # Add to top of .zshrc
   zmodload zsh/zprof
   
   # Add to bottom of .zshrc
   zprof
   ```

3. Consider lazy-loading rarely used tools or disabling unused plugins

#### Tool Version Mismatches

If you see version warnings during installation:

1. Update the specific tool:
   ```bash
   # For Homebrew packages
   brew upgrade [package-name]
   
   # For Starship
   curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. If you can't update, check if your configuration is compatible with your current version
