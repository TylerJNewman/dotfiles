# Making a Change to Your Dotfiles: Adding an Alias

I'll walk you through the complete process of adding a new alias to your dotfiles repository, from making the change to syncing it across your machines.

## Step 1: Navigate to the appropriate aliases file

```bash
# Go to your dotfiles directory
cd ~/dotfiles

# Open the relevant aliases file
# For example, if adding a git alias:
vim zsh/aliases/git.zsh
# Or for navigation aliases:
vim zsh/aliases/navigation.zsh
```

## Step 2: Add your new alias

For example, let's add an alias to quickly navigate to your projects directory:

```bash
# Inside zsh/aliases/navigation.zsh, add:
alias proj="cd ~/projects"
```

Save and close the file.

## Step 3: Test your new alias

```bash
# Source your zshrc to apply changes without restarting your terminal
source ~/.zshrc

# Test your new alias
proj
# This should take you to your projects directory
```

## Step 4: Commit your changes to the repository

```bash
# Go to your dotfiles directory (if you're not already there)
cd ~/dotfiles

# Check what files have changed
git status

# Add your modified file
git add zsh/aliases/navigation.zsh

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "[aliases] Add proj alias for quick navigation to projects directory"
```

## Step 5: Push to your remote repository (if using GitHub/GitLab)

```bash
git push
```

## Step 6: Sync to other machines (when needed)

On your other machines:

```bash
# Navigate to your dotfiles directory
cd ~/dotfiles

# Pull the latest changes
git pull

# Source your zshrc to apply the changes
source ~/.zshrc

# Test your new alias
proj
```

## Creating a New Alias File (if needed)

If you're adding aliases for a completely new category:

```bash
# Create a new file for the category
touch ~/dotfiles/zsh/aliases/new_category.zsh

# Add your aliases to this file
vim ~/dotfiles/zsh/aliases/new_category.zsh

# Ensure the main zshrc loads all files in the aliases directory
# This should already be set up in your main zshrc file
```

That's it! Your new alias is now:
1. Added to your configuration
2. Tested to ensure it works
3. Committed to your version control system
4. Available to sync to your other machines

This same workflow applies to any changes you want to make to your dotfiles, whether it's adding functions, changing configurations, or creating new setup files.
